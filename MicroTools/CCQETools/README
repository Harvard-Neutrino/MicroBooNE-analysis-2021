The files in this directory implement a fit to MicroBooNE's 2021
CCQE \nu_e appearance data. They make heavy use of the GNU
Scientific Library (https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), the GLoBES
library (https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/personalhomes/globes/), and its
sterile neutrino extension (included here in snu.c and snu.h).

The functions in muboone.cc contain the code needed to compute
MicroBooNE CCQE chi^2 values for a given parameter point, which
should have been set using the GLoBES function glbSetOscillationParameters
beforehand.

For https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10359, this code was embedded into a
larger software framework which we cannot share in full here because it
contains contributions by other authors which, even though unused in
https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10359, are nontrivial to remove.
(Please ask the authors if you are interested in the full code, which
has also been used in previous projects, for instance
https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10661, https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04294,
https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3011.)

We do, however, share the resulting MicroBooNE chi^2 tables:
  CCQE_noBkgOsc_Chi2_Data.dat   - fit to actual data
  CCQE_noBkgOsc_Chi2_Asimov.dat - fit to an Asimov data set

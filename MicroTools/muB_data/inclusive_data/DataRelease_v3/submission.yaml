comment: Data release for the first results from MicroBooNE's inclusive $\nu_e$CC search using Wire-Cell reconstruction, corresponding to information from arXiv:2110.13978. Attached is a python script which shows an example of how to use this data release to plot the unconstrained and constrained $\nu_e$CC FC data and predictions. Version 3 adds additional spectra and covariance matrices for 0p and Np exclusive $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ selections.

description: Fully contained $\nu_e$CC data, signal, background, and LEE(x=1) predictions constrained by the $\nu_e$CC PC, $\nu_\mu$CC FC, $\nu_\mu$CC PC, $\nu_\mu$CC $\pi^0$ FC, $\nu_\mu$CC $\pi^0$ PC, and NC $\pi^0$ channels under a LEE(x=0) hypothesis. Note that here we show the sum of the constrained signal and constrained background; due to correlations between signal and background, this is not identical to constraining after summing signal and background, but the difference here is minimal. Note that the rightmost bin is an overflow bin, containing all events with reconstructed neutrino energy greater than 2.5 GeV. The background includes neutral current events, $\nu_\mu$CC events, events with a true neutrino interaction vertex outside the fiducial volume (3 cm inside the TPC active volume), and cosmic ray backgrounds. The signal includes the remaining intrinsic $\nu_e$CC events. The LEE(x=1) includes the predicted excess from an unfolding of the MiniBooNE LEE under a $\nu_e$CC hypothesis.

description: $\nu_e$ CC FC covariance matrix showing uncertainties and correlations between bins due to flux uncertainties, cross-section uncertainties, hadron reinteraction uncertainties, detector systematic uncertainties, Monte-Carlo statistical uncertainties, and dirt (outside cryostat) uncertainties. For the data statistical uncertainty covariance matrix, (only diagonal elements, not included here), the Neyman, Pearson, or combined Neyman and Pearson (CNP) techniques can be used. This corresponds to LEE(x=0), the standard prediction with no low energy excess. This has been constrained by the $\nu_e$CC PC, $\nu_\mu$CC FC, $\nu_\mu$CC PC, $\nu_\mu$CC $\pi^0$ FC, $\nu_\mu$CC $\pi^0$ PC, and NC $\pi^0$ channels under a LEE(x=0) hypothesis. The 1-26th bins/rows/columns correspond to the 26 bins of reconstructed neutrino energy in the $\nu_e$CC FC channel.
